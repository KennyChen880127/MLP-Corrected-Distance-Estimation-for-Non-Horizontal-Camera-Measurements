# MLP-Corrected-Distance-Estimation-for-Non-Horizontal-Camera-Measurements
When the camera and the target object are not horizontally aligned for distance measurement, the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is utilized. It takes screen coordinates and the current measured distance as inputs to correct and predict the horizontal distance of the camera.
